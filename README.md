TicTacToe
=========

A game I made that was inspired by a maths class from school

The game has to have two players, however they can be on the same pc or on diffrent ones.

---
####Singleplayer
If you pass the argument `-undo` at start by calling `java -jar TicTacAdvanced.jar -undo` an undo button will be available. It will only work for one go only.

---
####Multiplayer
You will need to enter a username before you can join or create a server.
When you create a server it will be on your local machine and there for only those in your local area network can connect to it.
On the other hand if you use hamachi others can connect to you by useing your ipv4.
When you click join server, the game will look for a server on `localhost` (127.0.0.1) but you can change ip by clicking change ip and enter one in manualy.
Also there is an option to search for a game, the game will only look on your local area network for a game and will connect to it as soon as it can.
